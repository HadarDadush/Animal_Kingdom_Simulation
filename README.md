# Animal Kingdom Hierarchy

## Overview
This project simulates an animal kingdom in Java, implementing a simple animal hierarchy with different animal types such as mammals, birds, and reptiles. Each animal has its own behavior, including eating, sleeping, and other species-specific actions. The program uses object-oriented principles to model animals and their interactions.

## Features
- Simulates different animal behaviors such as eating, sleeping, and moving.
- Includes specific methods for each animal type, e.g., mammals hibernate, birds can fly.
- Utilizes inheritance and polymorphism to model the relationships between animal types.
- Each animal has a unique toString method to specify its class.
  
## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance & Polymorphism

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
